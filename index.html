    <!--About Me-->
  
    <h2 class="info">ABOUT ME</h2>
    <b>
      <p>
        Growing up, I've always been fascinated by the interplay between logic
        and creativity, which led me to pursue a law degree. However, my passion
        for technology never faded, despite my legal career. Transitioning from
        law to tech wasn't easy, but it was a journey I embarked on with
        determination and belief in myself.
      </p>
    </b>
    <b>
      <p>
        My journey into tech started with Data Analytics. But, discovering
        backend engineering felt like finding my niche—a perfect blend of
        analytical thinking and creative problem-solving. It resonated deeply
        with me, allowing me to leverage my legal background while delving into
        the technical challenges of building robust systems.
      </p>
    </b>
    <b>
      <p>
        So, when the opportunity arose to enrol in Altschool Africa's Backend
        Engineering program at the School of Engineering, I opted for it and was
        fortunate enough to be accepted.
